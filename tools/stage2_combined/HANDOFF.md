# Handoff — CYBER_SUZUKA stage2 combined test

Session handoff written 2026-08-23. Read this first, then `README.md`
in this same directory for the full chronological changelog (every
round quotes the user's exact Japanese instruction).

## Where things are

- **Main source**: `combined_test.asm` (this directory). Single file,
  assembled by `build_test.py` via `../mini_z80asm.py` (a custom, non-
  standard Z80 assembler — see "Assembler quirks" below).
- **Build**: `python3 build_test.py` from this directory. Writes
  `combined_test [ASCII16].rom` (also in this directory, committed to
  git — always rebuild and re-commit it after any `.asm` change).
- **Regression suite**: `tests/` (in this directory, **just added to
  git this session** — previously these lived only in an ephemeral
  scratchpad and would NOT have survived a session handoff). Run
  `python3 tests/run_all.py` for the full suite (180 checks as of this
  commit). Each file is also independently runnable and self-reports
  `N passed, M failed`.
- **Emulator**: `../z80emu.py` — a from-scratch Z80 interpreter used
  for all verification. Known limitation: **no interrupt simulation**
  and no cycle-accurate VDP timing. This was the root cause of one real
  bug this session (see README's `STACKTOP` entry) — when a class of
  bug seems invisible to sweeps, consider measuring something more
  directly (e.g. SP depth mid-frame) rather than trusting a sweep alone.
- **Visual verification**: `render_check.py` renders VRAM state to a
  PPM image (`render_full(cpu.vram, path)`). `tests/night_visual_check.py`
  is a working example. Convert to PNG with PIL if you need to actually
  look at it (`Image.open(...).save(...)`).

## The user

Communicates in terse, often angry Japanese. Expects:
- Every change verified via the emulator (unit tests + a real
  `MAINLOOP`-driven sweep, not just static reasoning) before being
  reported as done.
- README changelog entries quoting their exact Japanese instruction
  verbatim, describing what was verified.
- A ROM sent after every round via the file-delivery mechanism.
- **Never** attribute a reported bug to their own testing, timing, or
  environment without hard, direct proof — this has caused real anger
  multiple times in the project history. If a fix seems to depend on
  "you didn't wait long enough" or similar, that reasoning needs to be
  airtight and phrased as a mechanism you found, not an excuse.
- Concise Japanese replies. No hedging language when reporting results
  — either it's verified or say plainly what's still uncertain.
- Commits use the trailer:

## Recently learned, non-obvious facts about this codebase

- **"カウンター" (counter) means `GAME_TICK`**, not raw frame count and
  not `ENEMY_SPAWN_COUNT`. `GAME_TICK` is the number `GAME_TICK_DISPLAY`
  draws top-right, and it only advances once every 8 raw frames (see
  its own INIT-area comment: "Stage1は地形書き換え8回に1回カウントす
  る作り すべての基準はこのカウント"). This was gotten wrong twice in
  a row before landing on the right variable — see README's "カウンタ
  ー" entries for the full story. If a future instruction mentions a
  "counter" threshold, it almost certainly means `GAME_TICK`, not
  frames and not any other internal counter.
- **Row numbering is 1-indexed in the user's own instructions** (row0 =
  "1st row", row1 = "2nd row", etc.) even though the code is obviously
  0-indexed. Confirmed via a real screenshot correction (see README's
  `NIGHT_START_ROW` entry). When an instruction says "N行目", it means
  0-indexed row `N-1`. Counting **from the bottom** ("下からN行目") is
  an ordinary ordinal count and does NOT have this ambiguity (1st from
  the bottom = the literal last row) — only counting from the top does.
- **SCREEN1 color is per 8-code group, not per screen position.** Any
  time you need two different colors for the same pattern/shape
  depending on context (day vs night, sky vs rock), you need a whole
  new pattern code (usually a byte-for-byte copy of the existing
  pattern data) in its own dedicated group — you cannot recolor a
  shared code conditionally. This session added `NIGHT_CODE` (group17)
  and `BULLETF_NIGHT_CODE`/`BULLETF_L_NIGHT_CODE` (group18) for exactly
  this reason. Groups 0-16 and 31 are taken (terrain/rock/sand/HUD/
  life-bar/digits/bullets/SkySand) — 19-30 are still free, minus
  whatever this session used most recently (check `combined_test.asm`
  for the latest `EQU ... group` comments before allocating a new one).
- **The custom assembler (`mini_z80asm.py`) is missing ordinary Z80
  instructions** — confirmed missing: `EX DE,HL` (use `LD D,H : LD E,L`
  instead). Its expression evaluator only supports `+ - * /`, left-to-
  right, no operator precedence and no parentheses — write constant
  expressions as plain literals rather than anything clever.
- **Night-transition effect** (`CHECK_NIGHT`, `NIGHT_START_TICK`=850 in
  `GAME_TICK` units as of this session, was 100 then 900): sweeps 1 more
  row black every `NIGHT_INTERVAL`(8 as of this session, was 16)
  `GAME_TICK`s, from `NIGHT_START_ROW`(1) through `NIGHT_END_ROW`(16,
  the SkySand row). `NIGHT_ROW` (RAM) tracks the current leading row —
  compare a row number against it (`NIGHT_ROW>=row` means "already
  darkened by the sweep") any time new code needs to know whether a
  specific row is currently dark. Don't gate on
  `GAME_TICK>=NIGHT_START_TICK` alone for anything row-specific — the
  sweep takes real time to reach any given row. Also: any GAME_TICK
  threshold compare MUST be a real 16-bit one (`SBC HL,DE`, the idiom
  `CHECK_NIGHT`'s own timer uses) once the threshold can exceed 255 -
  Z80's `CP` only ever takes an 8-bit immediate, and this custom
  assembler silently truncates an out-of-range one with no error
  (`n & 0xFF`, no range check) instead of failing the build. Found
  exactly this bug in `CLOUD_UPDATE_ALL`'s own cloud-stop gate when
  `NIGHT_START_TICK` moved from 100 to 900 this session — see README's
  own entry on it for the full story.
- **Endgame `GAME_TICK` timeline, all sharing one clock**:
  `NIGHT_START_TICK`(850) starts the night sweep above; `ENEMY_SPAWN_
  STOP_TICK`(950) stops every ordinary enemy type (ZacoII/Zum/BigZum/
  Flyer/Etank) from spawning again, via a shared `SPAWN_STOPPED` helper
  every `ALLOC_*_SLOT` routine calls first — don't add a 6th hand-
  rolled `GAME_TICK` compare for a new enemy type, call this instead;
  `BOSS_SPAWN_TICK`(999) spawns the boss (Sasapi) once. By direct
  instruction ("自機以外はもうスポーンしないんで オールフリー"), once
  spawning has stopped at 950 every ordinary enemy's own hw-sprite-slot
  and pattern-VRAM budget is fair game to reuse for later systems (the
  boss reuses Zum/BigZum/Flyer/Etank's hw slots10-25 and BigZum's whole
  pattern-code footprint 156-219, loaded fresh at boss-spawn time, not
  INIT) — the real budget (32 hw sprite slots, ~256 sprite pattern
  codes) doesn't have room for a 64x64 boss (16 hw-sprite quadrants, 64
  pattern codes) as a NEW permanent allocation on top of everything
  already using it.
- **Sprite pattern VRAM has a real base offset (`SPRPAT`=0x3800h) that's
  easy to forget** — a hardware sprite's pattern data lives at
  `SPRPAT+pattern*8`, NOT `pattern*8` alone (that bare form lands in the
  BG pattern table's own address space instead, silently). Missing
  `+SPRPAT` on a fresh `LDIRVM` pattern load produces a build that
  passes unit tests testing VRAM state against itself (comparing loaded
  bytes against the SAME wrong address the buggy code wrote to) but
  renders visibly wrong (leftover/garbage patterns) the moment you
  actually render a frame — caught exactly this way building the boss
  this session. Any pattern-load check needs to compare against
  `SPRPAT+PAT_xxx*8`, and any new sprite needs an actual render, not
  just unit tests, before calling it verified.

- **Any VRAM write bigger or more frequent than this file's usual small
  per-frame sprite writes needs its own DI/EI interrupt-safety check —
  don't assume an existing unprotected `LDIRVM` call is "safe
  precedent" just because nothing was reported against IT yet.** This
  file already documents the bug class once (`UPDATE_TANK_SPRITES`'s
  own comment: `LDIRVM` has no interrupt-safety margin, `MAINLOOP`
  never `HALT`s for vblank, so an H.TIMI landing mid-write can corrupt
  the VDP's own write-address counter and scribble stray bytes wherever
  the interrupt handler leaves it — real-hardware garbage `z80emu.py`
  can never reproduce, since it has no interrupt simulation at all).
  This session repeated it building the boss (`FLUSH_BOSS_SPRITES`'s
  64-byte single-`DI` burst — 2x this file's next-biggest per-frame
  sprite write, BigZum's 32 — and `LOAD_SASAPI_PATTERNS`'s wholly
  unprotected 512-byte `LDIRVM`), reported back as real "tearing, plus
  small garbage at unrelated VRAM locations" - exactly this bug's own
  signature, not a sprite-priority/scanline-count issue (that theory
  was floated first and was WRONG — see README's own correction entry).
  Fixed by chunking the per-frame write into 16 small per-quadrant
  DI/EI-wrapped mini-bursts, and wrapping the rare (not per-frame)
  512-byte load in a plain DI/EI pair. **Etank's own analogous runtime
  pattern-VRAM share (`PAT_ETANK_BL`/`_BR`, 64 bytes) still has this
  exact same unprotected-`LDIRVM` exposure and was NOT fixed this
  session** (out of scope, left as a known latent issue, not "proven
  safe") — worth fixing preemptively rather than waiting for it to get
  reported the same way.
- MSX1/TMS9918 also has a real per-scanline sprite limit (max 4,
  separate from — and much stricter than — the 32-slot total budget),
  which `z80emu.py` doesn't model either. The boss's own 4x4 quadrant
  grid was already deliberately designed around this (confirmed by
  direct instruction: "敵の出現制限も全て横並びを回避するため") — this
  was NOT the cause of the flicker reported this session (see above),
  but keep it in mind for any other future wide/tall sprite.
  Keep this in mind for any future wide/tall sprite built from ordinary
  (non-magnified) 16x16 hw sprites.

## Open items / things to watch

- No known open bugs as of this handoff — the boss's own SPRPAT bug
  (see above) was caught and fixed before shipping; the last several
  rounds before that were bug reports against the night effect and
  horizontal-shot coloring, all resolved and verified (see README's
  most recent entries). The per-scanline flicker (see above) is a real
  hardware limit, not something fixed in code.
- **The boss (Sasapi) has spawn+patrol movement (both facings, reloaded
  on direction change) only** — HP is stored (255) but nothing reads or
  decrements it, no collision box, no death/explosion state. Deliberate
  scope so far ("取り敢えず確認") — don't assume any of it exists until
  asked to add it.
- `BOSS_SPAWN_Y`(56) was read as "the sprite's own bottom edge sits 8px
  above SkySand's top row" - an interpretation, not confirmed by a
  screenshot yet. If a future instruction implies a different vertical
  position, that's the thing to revisit first, same as
  `NIGHT_START_ROW`'s own history of a wrong first guess.
- **BigZum's own STATE field now goes up to 5** (forced retreat once
  `GAME_TICK>=ENEMY_SPAWN_STOP_TICK` - see `UPDATE_ONE_BIGZUM`'s own
  top-of-function check) - any future code reading/switching on
  `BIGZUM_POOL+7` needs to account for this 6th value, not just 0-4.
- The row-range boundaries in the night-glyph work (`DRAW_BULLET_CELL`,
  `ERASE_BULLET_CELL`) went through 2 wrong guesses before landing
  correctly — re-read the last 4-5 README entries in full before
  touching that code again, the reasoning is subtle (SCREEN1 color-
  group constraints + the SkySand row's own special status).
- `tools/stage2_combined/scratchpad`-style one-off diagnostic scripts
  (sweeps, debug traces, etc.) are NOT in `tests/` and were NOT carried
  over — only the durable, README-referenced regression suite was.
  If you need to re-run a specific historical investigation, it isn't
  here; you'd write a fresh one using `tests/banked_helpers.py`.
